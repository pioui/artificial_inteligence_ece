## Lab 1
The aim of the work is to apply algorithms for searching and finding the best path in a NxN maze.
Application of: Astar, Djikstra, Best-first search with different heuristics

## Lab 2
The aim of the work is to build a Recommendation System for movies. These suggestions will stem both from the characteristics of the film and from certain evaluations of each user.

## Lab 3
The aim of the work is to build a Recommendation System for movies. As in the previous work, recommendations will be derived from both movie features and user ratings. The Recommender is built through machine learning algorithms and specifically through decision trees.
